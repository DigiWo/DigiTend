An attendance management app developed for the CS department at SMVDU. 
This app is meant to be used by the teaching faculty and automates attendance upload to the server which was previously done manually.
The app fetches the student list for each class and stores it in the device memory.
The professor can then mark attendance for students and this information is periodically uploaded to the server using JSON packets.
